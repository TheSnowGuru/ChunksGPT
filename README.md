# ChunksGPT - Codebase Refactoring Assistant

This project aims to assist developers with refactoring and improving their codebases using OpenAI's ChatGPT. The goal is to create a collaborative environment where the community can contribute, enhance, and build upon the codebase refactoring process.

## Overview

The Codebase Refactoring Assistant divides a codebase into smaller modules, generates summaries for each module, processes the modules iteratively with ChatGPT, integrates the insights and suggestions provided by ChatGPT back into the codebase, and validates and tests the modified codebase to ensure it works as intended.

## Features

- Load codebase from a GitHub repository URL
- Divide the codebase into smaller modules within ChatGPT's token limit
- Generate summaries for each module to provide context to ChatGPT
- Process each module with ChatGPT and validate the output
- Integrate the results back into the codebase
- Validate and test the modified codebase using Python's unittest framework
- Create codebase schema in dot language

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codebase-refactoring-assistant.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Update `main.py` with the GitHub URL of your code file.

5. Run `main.py`:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

6. Run the unittests in `validation_testing.py`:

   ```
   python validation_testing.py
   ```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to improve and expand the Codebase Refactoring Assistant. If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue to discuss your ideas.

### Ideas for Improvement

1. **Codebase visualization**: Generate visual representations of the codebase's structure, dependencies, and call graphs to help users better understand and navigate their projects.

2. **Automated code review**: Integrate the ability to perform automated code reviews, providing suggestions on code quality, style, and best practices based on established guidelines.

3. **Code refactoring suggestions**: Offer specific refactoring suggestions and alternatives to improve code readability, maintainability, and performance.

4. **Integration with popular IDEs**: Develop plugins or extensions for popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IntelliJ IDEA to allow users to access the refactoring assistant directly within their preferred coding environment.

5. **Multi-language support**: Extend the capabilities of the assistant to handle codebases written in multiple programming languages, offering a more versatile experience for developers working with diverse tech stacks.

6. **Smart code search**: Implement a smart code search feature to quickly locate and navigate to specific functions, classes, or variables within the codebase.

7. **Automated testing**: Provide automated testing capabilities, allowing users to generate and run test cases based on the codebase's functions and methods, ensuring that all aspects of the application are thoroughly tested.

8. **Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) support**: Integrate with popular CI/CD platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins, enabling the refactoring assistant to be part of the development pipeline.

9. **Performance profiling and optimization**: Incorporate performance profiling tools to analyze and identify performance bottlenecks within the codebase, offering recommendations for optimization and performance improvements.

10. **Collaborative coding**: Enable real-time collaboration between developers, allowing multiple users to work on the same codebase simultaneously, discuss refactoring ideas, and review suggestions from the assistant together.
